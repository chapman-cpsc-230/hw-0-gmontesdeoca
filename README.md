## Description

For this assignment I downloaded the .md file from GitHub for editing in Atom and then pushed it back up to the GitHub repository being used for our homework.

## What I Learned from This

I learned how to download the file from GitHub to my computer and how to edit the file for homework. I also learned how to push the file back up to the GitHub repository.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
